#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/5MFSrctabtest](https://shinyappstore.com/a/5MFSrctabtest)__

5MFSrctabtest, a valuable component of the MEPHAS suite, is designed for conducting tests for contingency tables, providing a powerful resource for statistical analyses. In data science, a contingency table organizes data to analyze associations between case-control status and factor categories. MEPHAS, an open-source and free web-interactive platform, supports statistical data analyses, especially catering to researchers. The 5MFSrctabtest application offers an interface with distinct tabs, including Chi-square Test, Fisher Exact Test, McNemar Test for Paired Data, Kappa Statistic, Mantel-Haenszel Test, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test. Users can leverage this tool to determine associations, assess proportions in independent samples, evaluate homogeneity, and generate percentage tables and plots with expected values, providing researchers with a suite for analyzing complex contingency table scenarios with ease. original publication: BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 May 11;21(1):183.
